# AI-INTERN
During my internship at Internship Studio, I focused on developing AI algorithms for language translation, specifically converting German to English. I worked closely with a talented team, conducting research, and implementing advanced natural language processing techniques. The experience allowed me to deepen my understanding of AI and language processing. I also learned to navigate the challenges of translating between different languages, improving my problem-solving skills. I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to such an exciting project and for the valuable skills and knowledge gained during my time at Internship Studio.
